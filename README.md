# LinkedIn-Connection-Bot
Written in Python, this program uses Selenium Webdriver to automate your connections in LinkedIn.

### Installation
1. Install python 3.
2. For this specific program, you will need Google Chrome browser and its repective chromedriver.exe which can be downloaded from **[here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)**. Make sure the version of chromedriver.exe matches the Google Chrome browser's verison.
3. After you've downloaded the chromedriver.exe, put it inside the root folder of the repository downloaded. For initial test, I've used the latest driver. You can replace it with whatever Chrome version you have.

4. Run main.py with python in terminal.

### Purpose
This bot is used for practice and learning purpose. This bot hasn't been used in any commercial form.

#### Know Issues
1. This bot doesn't handle rare captchas by LinkedIn in the start. For this, the program should be ran again.
2. This bot only works with People and connections.
3. Connections with Premium account and private profile are not handled by the bot. However, the missed profiles are shown in the terminal as the bot encounters one.

Have a nice networking!
